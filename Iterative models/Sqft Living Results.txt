Using cross fold validation(CFV) the best single numeric feature for
simple linear regression is sqft_living.

R squared values are listed below

PARAMETRIC MODELs:

linear = .487

quadratic = .527

best_deg_poly = .538 (deg = 8, found by CFV)


NON PARAMETRIC MODELS

K_NN = 0.5016 (k = 25, chosen by CFV)
However CFV had lesser turning pts at other values, see graph in file

weighted_25_NN = 0.4765 (weights = 1 / (distance+1) , ad hoc weights)
CFV gave 25 as an approximate value


uniform_kernel = 0.507 (lambda = 150 )
## 150 is smallest value possible not cross validated as best

gaussian_kernel = 0.5415 (lambda = 5,000, found with CFV )
