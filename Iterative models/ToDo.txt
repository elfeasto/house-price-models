UNIFORM KERNEL REGRESSION
USE CFV to find best distance, note distance can be at a minimum 150
(see file for logic)

MIXED MODEL:
Try to mix uniform or other kernel regression with bounded support with a
nearest neighbour model

Bounded kernel regression must have its distance parameter at least a certain
number, D, say. (This number is the distance between the house in the test set that
is furthest from any training set house and the house that it is nearest)

If we want to use a number that is below D, d ,say we can use a mix of Kernel and
K_NN regresion as follows:

for house in test set:
    if min_dist(house, all training houses) < D:
        Use K_NN prediction
    else:
        Use Kernel prediction with parameter d
