Using cross fold validation(CFV) the best single numeric feature for
simple linear regression is sqft_living.

Everything below is using sqft_living as the only feature(assumed it
is the best single feature to use)

R squared values are listed below

PARAMETRIC MODELs:

linear = .487

quadratic = .527

best_deg_poly = .538 (deg = 8, found by CFV)


NON PARAMETRIC MODELS

K_NN = .499 (k = 35, chosen by CFV)

weighted_10_NN = 0.4765 (weights = 1 / (distance+1) , ad hoc weights)
## do cross validation for k, not yet done

uniform_kernel = 0.507 (lambda = 150 )
## 150 is smallest value possible not cross validated as best

gaussian_kernel = 0.5415 (lambda = 5,000, found with CFV )
