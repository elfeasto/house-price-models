make a class called an area
it is either:
1. A collection of grids
2. Not in any grid

Parameters:
1. List of grids
2. Area inside or outside or these grids

properties:
all grids should have the same value? no want to assign value
so should be able to calculate the value of the area
calculate area by getting mean diff for all houses in the area


should have a label for the area eg, high value, or green(green being gud)
